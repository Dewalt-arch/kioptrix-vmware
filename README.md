Kiotprix Level 1 corrected vmx file for Nat networks

This .vmx file is for VMWARE ONLY! 
This has been corrected for the pre-vmware14 bug of being stuck in "Bridged" mode. 

Corrected "Bridged" to "Nat"

Download or clone the .vmx file, and overwrite the original .vmx file that came 
with Kioptrix Level 1 with this one , BEFORE importing the vm into vmware.
